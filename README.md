# Mind & Body App Website

Uses the Cayman Jekyll theme and then overrides a little:
- The layout: by adding a layouts/default.html file
- The colour scheme: by adding a assets/css/style.scss file

All text is added in the index file
Original theme available at: https://pages-themes.github.io/cayman/
